# Snake Game 

## Introduction

We have created a classic Snake game and implemented in C++ . The game challenges players to navigate a growing snake across a bounded grid while consuming randomly spawning fruits. The player must avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body to continue scoring points. The features of the game include: colourful game rendering, multiple difficulty levels, real time input handling, random fruit generation, tail growth mechanic and display message of “GAME OVER”.

# Features
- Colorful game rendering
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Real-time input handling
- Random fruit generation
- Tail growth mechanic
- "GAME OVER" display message

## How to Play

- Use the following keys to control the snake:
  - `W` → Move Up
  - `A` → Move Left
  - `S` → Move Down
  - `D` → Move Right
  - `X` → Quit Game
- The snake grows longer each time it eats a fruit.
- Avoid colliding with walls or the snake's own body, or the game will end.
- The game displays a "GAME OVER" message when you lose, and you can choose to restart.

## Screenshot of the Game

Upon running the code, we will see a welcome message followed by instructions and then selecting the difficulty level.

Once the difficulty level is chosen, the game starts. Pressing one of the movement keys (`A`, `W`, `S`, `D`) will make the snake move.
